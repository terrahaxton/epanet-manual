Print Preview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To preview a printout, select **File >> Print Preview** from the main
   menu. A Preview form will appear which shows how each page of the

   EPANET workspace select **File >> Print** from the main menu or click
   |image141| on the Standard Toolbar. The following views can be

       plots)

    -  Status, Energy, Calibration, and Reaction Reports.


Copying to the Clipboard or to a File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   EPANET can copy the text and graphics of the current window being
   viewed to both the Windows clipboard and to a file. Views that can be
   copied in this fashion include the Network Map, graphs, tables, and
   reports. To copy the current view to the clipboard or to file:

    1. Select **Edit >> Copy To** from the main menu or click |image142|.

    2. Select choices from the Copy dialog that appears (see Figure 10.2)
       and click its **OK** button.

    3. If you selected to copy-to-file, enter the name of the file in the
       Save As dialog box that appears and click **OK**.


   Use the Copy dialog as follows to define how you want your data
   copied and to where:

    1. Select a destination for the material being copied (Clipboard or
       File)

    2. Select a format to copy in:

       -  Bitmap (graphics only)

       -  Metafile (graphics only)

       -  Data (text, selected cells in a table, or data used to construct a
          graph)

    3. Click **OK** to accept your selections or **Cancel** to cancel the
       copy request.
